# 📅 3-Month Frontend Interview Prep Plan (20 Hours/Week)

**Goal**: Prepare for Senior Frontend Developer interviews with a structured plan that builds Core JS mastery, project experience using ES6+, and React framework proficiency.

---

## ✅ Phase 1: JavaScript Mastery & Interview Challenges (Weeks 1–4)

**Time**: ~80 hours  
**Goal**: Deep understanding of JS fundamentals and solving real interview-style problems

### 🔹 Focus Areas
- Variables, Scopes, Hoisting, Closures
- `this`, call/apply/bind
- Prototypes & Inheritance
- Asynchronous JS: Promises, async/await, Event Loop
- ES6+ features
- Execution context, memory, and call stack
- DOM, BOM, and event handling

### 🛠️ Weekly Breakdown

| Week | Topics |
|------|--------|
| 1    | Variables, Scope, Hoisting, Closures, TDZ |
| 2    | `this`, call/apply/bind, prototype chain, OOP in JS |
| 3    | Promises, async/await, microtask vs macrotask |
| 4    | Modules, ES6+, and in-depth DOM + event handling |

### 🎯 Tasks
- Solve 60–80 short interview-style JS questions
- Maintain deep-dive notes and code samples
- Practice explaining code snippets out loud
- Organize in folders like:
  ```
  javascript-interview-fundamentals/
  └── scoping-hoisting-variables/
      ├── notes/
      ├── questions/
      ├── practice/
  ```

- Event handling and forms
- Hooks: `useState`, `useEffect`
- Component composition & reuse
- Routing (`react-router-dom`)
- Optional: Unit Testing with RTL

### 📁 Suggested Folder Structure
```
