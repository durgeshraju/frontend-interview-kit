Essential JavaScript topics to focus on for frontend interviews should build on your core fundamentals and cover common interview ground.


| Priority | Topic                                               | Why Start Here?                                                                                    |
| -------- | --------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **1**    | **Core JavaScript Concepts (Advanced)**             | Deep understanding of `this`, closures, scope, hoisting is a must for interviews.                  |
| **2**    | **Functions Mastery**                               | Interviewers love asking about currying, higher-order functions, and callback patterns.            |
| **3**    | **ES6+ Features Deep Dive**                         | Modern JS usage is expected – destructuring, optional chaining, spread/rest – all are common.      |
| **4**    | **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in JavaScript** | OOP is key for structure-based questions and class-based implementation (e.g., custom components). |
| **5**    | **Event Loop & Execution Order (Async Internals)**  | Understanding `setTimeout` vs `Promise` vs `async/await` order is a **must**.                      |
| **6**    | **DOM & Browser APIs**                              | Covers your frontend knowledge – many interviewers ask about DOM events, bubbling, delegation.     |
| **7**    | **Data Structures in JavaScript**                   | Foundation for solving algorithm-style problems (string/array/object questions).                   |
| **8**    | **Math, Dates & Utility Logic**                     | These show up in practical logic questions (e.g., working with timeouts, ages, timers).            |
| **9**    | **Testing Fundamentals (Jest/Mocking)**             | Not all companies test this, but it’s a **nice-to-have** if you're aiming for better quality jobs. |
| **10**   | **Performance Optimization & Memory**               | Bonus category – useful for senior/mid-level roles but less common in regular interviews.          |
