# ðŸ§° Frontend Interview Kit

This repository is specifically designed to help **frontend developers build confidence for technical interviews** by mastering core concepts, solving real-world logic problems, and understanding how frontend technologies work behind the scenes.

Unlike typical project-based repositories, this kit focuses entirely on **fundamentals, patterns, and problem-solving skills** that are **frequently asked in interviews** â€” especially in mid-level frontend roles.

## ðŸŽ¯ Who is this for?

- Frontend developers preparing for job interviews
- Self-learners who want a clear, structured prep guide
- Developers looking to strengthen JS, React, DOM, and browser API skills
- Anyone who prefers **depth over quantity** in preparation
