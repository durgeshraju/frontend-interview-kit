# 07 â€“ Loops: JavaScript Coding Practice

Master loops in JavaScript by solving real-world problems. Understand how `for`, `while`, and `for...of` loops work through practice.

---

## ðŸ§  Problem 1: Print 1 to N

**Task:**  
Write a function `printNumbers(n)` that prints numbers from 1 to `n`.

**Example:**  
```js
printNumbers(5)
// Output: 1 2 3 4 5
```

**Mental Hook:**  
Think of a `for` loop as your number line walker.

---

## ðŸ§  Problem 2: Sum of Numbers from 1 to N

**Task:**  
Write a function `sumToN(n)` that returns the sum of numbers from 1 to `n`.

**Example:**  
```js
sumToN(4)
// Output: 10
```

**Mental Hook:**  
You're gathering candies one by one. Use a loop to add them up!

---

## ðŸ§  Problem 3: Reverse a String

**Task:**  
Write a function `reverseStr(str)` that reverses the input string.

**Example:**  
```js
reverseStr("hello")
// Output: "olleh"
```

**Mental Hook:**  
Start from the end and walk backwards â€“ like reading from a mirror.

---

## ðŸ§  Problem 4: Find Factorial of a Number

**Task:**  
Write a function `factorial(n)` that returns the factorial of a number.

**Example:**  
```js
factorial(5)
// Output: 120
```

**Mental Hook:**  
Itâ€™s a multiplication ladder! Climb from `n` down to 1.

---

## ðŸ§  Problem 5: Count Vowels in a String

**Task:**  
Write a function `countVowels(str)` that returns the number of vowels in the string.

**Example:**  
```js
countVowels("developer")
// Output: 4
```

**Mental Hook:**  
Use `for...of` to examine each letter and count vowels!

---

## ðŸ§  Problem 6: Loop through Array and Double Values

**Task:**  
Write a function `doubleValues(arr)` that returns a new array where each number is doubled.

**Example:**  
```js
doubleValues([1, 2, 3])
// Output: [2, 4, 6]
```

**Mental Hook:**  
Scan and transform â€“ loop is your paintbrush here!

---

## ðŸ§  Problem 7: Nested Loop â€“ Multiplication Table

**Task:**  
Print multiplication table from 1 to 5 using nested loops.

**Example Output:**
```
1 x 1 = 1
1 x 2 = 2
...
5 x 5 = 25
```

**Mental Hook:**  
Nested loops are loops inside loops. Think of a grid layout!

## âœ… Keep Practicing

Make sure to:
- Understand the loop logic.
- Dry run your code.
- Explore edge cases (like 0 or negative numbers).
