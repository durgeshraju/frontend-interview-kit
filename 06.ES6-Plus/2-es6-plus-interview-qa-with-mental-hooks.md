# ES6++ JavaScript Interview Q&A – With 🧠 Mental Hooks

A comprehensive guide to ES6 and beyond for Frontend Developers. Each section includes clear explanations, real-world examples, and a sticky mental hook to help you retain concepts effectively.

## 1. Let, Const vs Var
### 🔍 Q: What's the difference between `var`, `let`, and `const`?
- `var`: Function-scoped, can be redeclared and updated.
- `let`: Block-scoped, cannot be redeclared in the same scope.
- `const`: Block-scoped, cannot be redeclared or reassigned.

🧠 **Mental Hook**:  
Think of `var` as "old school", `let` as "flexible modern", and `const` as "locked in".

## 2. Arrow Functions
### 🔍 Q: What are arrow functions and how are they different from regular functions?
- Do not bind their own `this`.
- More concise syntax.

🧠 **Mental Hook**:  
Arrow 🚀 = fast, short, and `this`-less.

---

## 3. Template Literals
### 🔍 Q: What are template literals in ES6?
- Strings with embedded expressions using backticks (\` \`).

🧠 **Mental Hook**:  
Backticks = 🎯 dynamic strings with `${power}`.

---

## 4. Default Parameters
### 🔍 Q: Why are default parameters useful?
- Assigns default values if no argument is passed.

🧠 **Mental Hook**:  
"Fallback plan" for your function.

---

## 5. Destructuring
### 🔍 Q: What's destructuring in JavaScript?
- Extracts values from arrays or properties from objects.

🧠 **Mental Hook**:  
Unpacking suitcase 🧳 into named drawers.

---

## 6. Spread & Rest Operators
### 🔍 Q: What's the difference between `...spread` and `...rest`?
- `...spread`: Expands.
- `...rest`: Collects.

🧠 **Mental Hook**:  
Spread = Pour 🫗 → rest = Gather 🧺

---

## 7. Enhanced Object Literals
### 🔍 Q: What’s new in ES6 object literals?
- Shorthand properties, method definitions, computed keys.

🧠 **Mental Hook**:  
Less typing ✍️, more doing ⚡

---

## 8. Promises
### 🔍 Q: What is a Promise?
- Object representing the eventual completion (or failure) of an async operation.

🧠 **Mental Hook**:  
Promise = Pinky swear 🤞 for async tasks.

---

## 9. Classes in JS
### 🔍 Q: What are classes in JavaScript?
- Syntactic sugar over prototype-based inheritance.

🧠 **Mental Hook**:  
Blueprint 🏗️ for objects.

---

## 10. Modules (import/export)
### 🔍 Q: What are ES6 modules?
- Allow splitting code into reusable pieces.

🧠 **Mental Hook**:  
Like Lego bricks 🧱—snap together what you need.

---

## 11. Async/Await
### 🔍 Q: How is `async/await` better than `.then()`?
- Cleaner, readable syntax for handling promises.

🧠 **Mental Hook**:  
Talk async like sync 🗣️

---

## 12. Optional Chaining & Nullish Coalescing
### 🔍 Q: What is optional chaining (`?.`) and nullish coalescing (`??`)?
- `?.`: Prevents errors when accessing nested properties.
- `??`: Provides fallback when value is `null` or `undefined`.

🧠 **Mental Hook**:  
Safe access + Smart fallback 🛡️➕
